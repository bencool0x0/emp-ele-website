<h2>Program Guidelines</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Mentors and mentees will meet for 30 minutes in every month of the semester or school year, with each date being scheduled in the previous meeting.</li>
    <li>If mentors or mentees need to reschedule the meeting, they must contact the other party at least 2 hours before the meeting.</li>
    <li>All communication should be between the parent/guardian and mentor unless the parent/guardian gives consent for direct communication to the student.</li>
    <li>Information about mentees will be kept confidential. Mentors should not share any personal information about their mentee unless written consent has been provided.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mentors and mentees can choose whether they would prefer to meet in person or online, such as on zoom, by filling in their preferences on the form (or no preference). <ul>
        <li>We will provide mentors with a fully upgraded zoom account.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Meetings in person will take place in locations where adults are present such as a public library.</li>
    <li>Mentors and mentees meeting online through zoom must do the following: <ul>
        <li>Find a quiet, appropriate place to minimize distractions and be able to concentrate on the discussion.</li>
        <li>Students must behave like they are at school.</li>
        <li>Parents or guardians should be accessible during the meetings and present for in-person meetings.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Volunteer Hours (for Mentors)</h3>

<p>The parent or guardian of the mentee and the Empower and Elevateâ€™s Board of Directors will sign off for the amount of time the mentor spent in meetings and preparation.</p>

<h1>Our Team</h1>

<p>We are a team of high schoolers from Pleasanton. As beneficiaries of the privileges of having parents who work in high tech, it would mean a great deal for us as students to reach out to others who are less equipped to compete in the high-tech world.</p>
