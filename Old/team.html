    <h1>Our Team</h1>

    <p>We are a team of high schoolers from Pleasanton. As beneficiaries of the privileges of having parents who work in
      high tech, it would mean a great deal for us as students to reach out to others who are less equipped to compete
      in the high-tech world.</p>

    <br>

    <p>insert pictures of people and their respective jobs, and maybe even bios for everyone</p>

    <br>

  <p>Please reach out to us at <a href="contact@empowerandelevate.org">contact@empowerandelevate.org</a> for any further
    questions or concerns.</p>
